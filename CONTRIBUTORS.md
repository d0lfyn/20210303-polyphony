## Thanks to:

Jochen Hertle, for [his solution](https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/t/choosing-random-ints-favouring-large-small/5234/2?u=d0lfyn) to the weighted random function which was adapted to `randWithWeight` in `general.rb`.

[amiika](https://github.com/amiika), creator of [Ziffers](https://github.com/amiika/ziffers), for [his suggestions and explanations](https://github.com/dolphinOfDelphi/20210303-polyphony/issues/7) of how to use modules and classes in the project.
